  <p>That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Don't fiddle with it all day. Trees grow however makes them happy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>

  <p>Let's have a happy little tree in here. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Use what you see, don't plan it.</p>

  <p>So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let your heart be your guide. What the devil. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>

  <p>Have fun with it. Let's make a happy little mountain now. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Use your imagination, let it go. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>

  <p>It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Just relax and let it flow. That easy. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>

  <p>If you hypnotize it, it will go away. A happy cloud. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>

  <p>Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Put it in, leave it alone. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.</p>

  <p>You are only limited by your imagination. Poor old tree. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.</p>

  <p>Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.</p>

  <p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We'll play with clouds today. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Let that brush dance around there and play. Just use the old one inch brush. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. I like to beat the brush. There it is.</p>
