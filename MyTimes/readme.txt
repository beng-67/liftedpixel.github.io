A week four Codecademy Pro project.

This one I had mostly done going in order with the steps on the site.
By the time I got to the end, my code was a mess.
I scrapped it and started over from scratch and it ended up a lot better.
I could still make the css better.
I did the nav how I thought they would want it, with a bunch of nested spans.
